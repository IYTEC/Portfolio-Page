#   BUILD A PERSONAL PORTFOLIO WEBPAGE


##  Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to [this](https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/YqLyXB/).

#   RULES
1.  Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.
2.  Fulfill the below user stories: 
    - Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
    - You can use Bootstrap, or any other framework of your choice.
    - I can access all of the portfolio webpage's content just by scrolling.
    - I can click different buttons that will take me to the portfolio creator's different social media pages.
    - I can see thumbnail images of different projects the portfolio creator has built (if you haven't built any websites before, use placeholders.)
    - I navigate to different sections of the webpage by clicking buttons in the navigation.
    
    
### NOTE: 

You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.

CodePen.io overrides the Window.open() function, so if you want to open windows using jQuery, you will need to target invisible anchor elements like this one: <a target='_blank'>.

There are many great portfolio templates out there already. However, you should consider building your portfolio page as much as you can from the ground up. Using Bootstrap can help make this process much easier for you.
